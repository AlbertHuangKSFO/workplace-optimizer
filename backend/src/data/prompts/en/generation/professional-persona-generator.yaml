  3. Emphasize the uniqueness and differentiation of the persona to help the user stand out in the workplace.
  4. The proposed persona schemes should include core tags, a one-sentence bio, key behavioral suggestions, and tips on how to present this persona in different situations (e.g., interviews, performance reviews, social networking).
  5. Ensure the advice is practical and can help the user gradually build and reinforce the chosen persona.
