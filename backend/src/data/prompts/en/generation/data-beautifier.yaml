  2. Make the data more understandable by reorganizing information, using more vivid language, and incorporating appropriate analogies or metaphors.
  3. Highlight key insights, trends, or achievements within the data, making them immediately apparent.
  4. Enhance the appeal of the data presentation, making it less dry and more capable of capturing the audience's attention.
